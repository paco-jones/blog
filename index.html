    <p>This is my personal blog and portfolio.
        I have been learning to code for a month, hence why this is such
        a rudimentary page at the moment. I am working toward becoming a web
        developer and this blog is my personal project to work on my skills as I
        learn them. </p>

     <p>I am 50. This is not something many people my age do. But I have never
        done what most people do so that's alright. I did start coding or programming
        in the 1980s with DOS, Basic, and Pascal. If I could have known what the future
        of programing and computing would be I might have made different choices. Had I 
        chosen to be a programer then, I assume I would be learning music or theatre or 
        film or photography right now. I have found in my 50 years, that I don't like to 
        leave things undone. Once I start a thing, even if it takes thirty years to 
        complete, I will eventually complete what I started.

        Life gets in the way sometimes. But while life is short in a sense, it is also
        not, it is quite a long path. Life if we are fortunate to live long enough
        gives us ample opportunity to make up for mistakes and learn things we set 
        aside when we were younger. I think my life experience and ability to ot give up 
        when things get difficult and my unending curiosity will be helpful in finding 
        my path to a career in web development.

        This webpage will be updated as I learn more. Right now it is pretty basic
        HTML and CSS. As I learn this page will reflect that knowledge I am acquiring. 
        I also, for fun, want to learn Python to script some randomized MIDI sequences to 
        add to the music I already create. Stay tuned. This is going to be fun.
