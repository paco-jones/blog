        Well, a bunch of things have happened since my last post, the layoffs of almost 40,000
        people in the field I am trying to enter and the advancement of AI in doing the job I am
        training for. It's been a roller coaster in my mind a to what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
        First, to all the people who were laid-off, I am sorry. You do not deserve this. Second, 
        it seems we as individuals cannot depend on any company to be dedicated to us. We as individuals 
        need to look out for and be dedicated to each other. That said, I am moving quickly through 
        freeCodeCamp and the The Odin Project. I would be happy to help anyone who is having trouble with
        the lessons I have already completed. git This will also help me learn. So please let me help you help me. 
    </p>

        I am also beginning to look for internships for front-end web development. 
        I feel confident that anything I don't know I can quickly learn as code 
        just works well with my brain. I am a born problem solver and code is the language of problem-solving. 
        So, not to ask but to ask, if a remote internship appears in your vicinity, I would be grateful if you
        thought of me. 
    </p>

        That's it for today. Might check around for classified documents. They seem to be lurking everywhere
        these days. Make sure you check under your bed. Hehehe. Until next time...

    <p>This is my personal blog and portfolio.
        I have been learning to code for a month, hence why this is such
        a rudimentary page at the moment. I am working toward becoming a web
        developer and this blog is my personal project to work on my skills as I
        learn them. </p>

     <p>I am 50. This is not something many people my age do. But I have never
        done what most people do so that's alright. I did start coding or programming
        in the 1980s with DOS, Basic, and Pascal. If I could have known what the future
        of programing and computing would be I might have made different choices. Had I 
        chosen to be a programer then, I assume I would be learning music or theatre or 
        film or photography right now. I have found in my 50 years, that I don't like to 
        leave things undone. Once I start a thing, even if it takes thirty years to 
        complete, I will eventually complete what I started. 
    </p>

        Life gets in the way sometimes. But while life is short in a sense, it is also
        not, it is quite a long path. Life if we are fortunate to live long enough,
        gives us ample opportunity to make up for mistakes and learn things we set 
        aside when we were younger. I think my life experience and ability to ot give up 
        when things get difficult and my unending curiosity will be helpful in finding 
        my path to a career in web development.

        This webpage will be updated as I learn more. Right now it is pretty basic
        HTML and CSS. As I learn, this page will reflect that knowledge I am acquiring. 
        I also, for fun, want to learn Python to script some randomized MIDI sequences to 
        add to the music I already create. Stay tuned. This is going to be fun.
